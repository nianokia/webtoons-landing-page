        Webtoons (Korean: ì›¹íˆ°), are a type of digital comic that originated in
        South Korea usually meant to be read on smartphones.
      </span>
      While webtoons were mostly unknown outside of Korea during their
      inception, there has been a surge in popularity internationally thanks in
      great part to the rise in popularity of manhwa and the fact that most
      manhwa are released as webtoons
